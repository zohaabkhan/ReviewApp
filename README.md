## Our Web APP

We want to create an web app that enchances the learning ability for CSC 4350 Class: Software Engineering. Our app would be based upon database with user accounts and ability to full acesss for your suceess. Upon entry to yoour account, you will be able to look at videos from Professor John lecture gaining more knowledge to his lesson. There be select videos that will help be sucessful in the class. There will also be acessible tab to quiz that will alow user to test there knowledge on speciffic tops in the videos building your more confidence in the class. The people we would target is students in the class, but also past or future who would like to gain on refresh there knowledge on software engineer class.

## Kaban Task

We created Kaban to organize the task of Creating the App

-Landing page (HTML/CSS/Flask/Py route/ Java Script)

-layout page (HTML/CSS/Flask/Py route/ Java Script)       

-login page (HTML/CSS/Flask/Py route/ postgres)

-signup page (HTML/CSS/Flask/Py route/ postgres)

-database for user (Post Gres)

-video page (HTMl/CSS/JavaScript)

-quiz page (HTMl/CSS/JavaScript)

-Description Pages (HTMl/CSS)

-route page (Python)

-ReadME

-Heroku

-.api/.env


## Zohaab Task

-login page

-signup page

-database for user

-route page 

-Heroku

-api/env

Zohaab Primary focus was on mostly was Back-End Development. He created the skeletons for the app and install database with postgres giving users the ability to sign up and even login into our app. Giving us ideas on the app layout and and using py route to give us specfics routes int the app. styling and creativity was used to to make sure the app was going. Lastly he implement the heroku to get the app to run and made sure code was completed with pylint and unit testing.
## Monica Task

-Video page

-quiz page

-creativity

-Decriptions 

organization

Monica bright mind is the reason why we created for this project. Her idea to implement this us made perfect since and could benefit other future student taking CSC 4350. She created the videos page and implemented slideshow to insure useability ands accessibility. Taking on the quiz page seemed to be one of the difficult task of this app, but she took on the challeneg and create quiz with reaction to the score at then end of answer. Some descriptions pages she created were route to certain buttons in the menu tab with clickable routes to them.
## Isaiah Task

-Landing Page 

-Description Page

-Read ME

Creativity with CSS

Isaiah play huge role in the Font end of development. Html and css was used strongly to create the landing page which can be useful for attracting audiencce/user with css styling. Also he created on of the description pages of summaries of application and the author of the app who created the app. Read me app was create to give teachers/viewers ability to look on on app decripstion and useful information on creating the app. Lastly goin over html and css pages to make sure the thier was fulency in the app.
## Issues/Fixes

-One issue that occured while creating was we were having trouble with heroku so we instied on trying another platform server to run the app which is not recommended by Professor John.

Zohaab fixed this by actuallly using the heroku app and process the correctly to get the app to run fairly without any side platforms and implementing postgres to insure the app usses the database correctly 


-Another issue was getting quiz formatted and being able to run easily.

Monica fixed this issue buy putting quiz question in one page html and and using other html pages to define spefic question from quiz and response on scire from quiz using javascript.
## Resouces

One use resouce was the ability for IM from Facebook named Scott Smithh that gave  us unique feedback and personal perference on our app. Very very experience with python, Scott gave us knowleddge on back end development with py routing, flask, and database which was useful for creating our app.

Another useful resouce was Professor John video that were illustaring in our app cause it gave us the basic compounds on how to create an app and roadmaps tools that would be useful in beiong sucessful with software engineering programming

Last useful resoure was each with us coming from different program background gave unique to the webb. We added our specialties to webb app and created somthing specfial that would be useful for future classes. 
## End

Our project shows how useful people with different programming background can use thrier stegthnes to create an useful web app. Weakness in the group were grown upon teaching abilittes from each other. This app was used to help other past and future students, but quite frankly, this app would have been useful if we when we was creating this video. Anyt student for knowlwgde and sucesss in software engineering would be find this app useful.
